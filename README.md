# Project1
This project is all about the integration of Python with docker using CGI(Common Gateway Interface) in Linux OS, CGI- An HTTP server invokes a Python CGI script so it can process user input that a user may submit through an HTML Form. Such a script usually lives in the server's special cgi-bin directory.
